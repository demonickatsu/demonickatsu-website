I realized I never actually introduced myself, so here we are.
My name is Katsu, and I write this website.
This is like my 5th try at making a website,
2 of them being suspended my my web host because no one went to them,
and the other 2 still up, those 2 being <a href="http://weneedtotalk.rf.gd/">this one</a> and <a href="http://ratpasta.rf.gd">this one.</a> 
There’s nothing really left to say, so goodbye!</p>

This is my first post, so it might sound really… unprofessional. Sorry.
But anyway, back to regularly scheduled programming. I made a software archive!</p>

<p><strong>What does that mean?</strong></p>

<p>It’s basically just a folder of software that’s either extremely hard to find or
just not available anymore, like Flash Player. I found most of this by going though old
download pages on the Internet Archive then downloading the files, then putting the files on here.
It’s a complicated process, but at least it’s simpler now because of this. 
I believe this qualifies as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a>, so this is legal. I’m not claiming to own
any of this software. I hope you like <a href="/software-archive/">the archive</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/software-archive/">Oh, yeah, and here’s the link.</a></p>

<p>Bye!</p>

(default Jekyll blog post)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2022/08/08/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
